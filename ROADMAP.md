# ROADMAP

This is our wishlist for new features.


## Make output fully TAP compliant

This will help integrate this test framework into automated pipelines.


## Ensure compatibility with Bash 3

Compatibility with old Bash versions is desired in order to increase adoption of this
tool, so that it can be used to add (or enhance) existing tests for legacy systems.


## Add static code verifications (linting)

To increase robustness and readability of the code.


## Include timeouts for tests

To detect unexpected hangs.


## Generate installation packages

For different package managers such as APT and RPM.


## Implement test plan declaration

So that it is required for tests to indicate how many tests are expected to run.


## Implement versioning system for this test framework

So that tests can specify for which specific version they were written.
